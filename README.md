## Development

PyCPIX is providing a collection of Python packages for different tasks:
- Support of USBpix (2.0/3.0) and adapter cards (e.g. GPAC) ([basil](https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/basil))
- FEI4 readout and data analysis ([pyBAR](https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/pyBAR))
- Support of features unique to each CMOS prototype (see Prototypes section)
